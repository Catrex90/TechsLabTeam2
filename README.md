# Project Scope - Techlabs Team 2
# Hotel Booking Exploratory Data Analysis

#  Introduction:

This project is part of the TECHSLABS DÃ¼sseldorf Winter Term Digital Shaper Project 2024 for the Data Science Track.
  
The project is based on the Kaggle project from NITESH YADAV https://www.kaggle.com/code/niteshyadav3103/hotel-booking-prediction-99-5-acc, who did a exploratory data analysis and some module building on a dataset about **hotel bookings**. The project's data has been taken from the following article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191#bib4.  

The dataset has data from two different hotels in Portugal: one city hotel located in Lisbon and another resort hotel situated in the Algarve. The collected data dates from the 1st of July 2015 and the 31st of August 2017. As data collection began in mid-2015 and ended in mid-2017, only 2016 is available as a complete year.
   
The dataset is an excellent way to compare the different hotel types with each other. We also want to carry out an exploratory data analysis and add some further questions, which are explained in the Projectscope.md you can find in the Docs folder.  Additional we want to correlate the data with the following dataset: **World Happiness** Report Dataset(s): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness/data and see, for example, whether or not there is a correlation between guests from countries with a high happiness score and repeated travels to a specific hotel.
